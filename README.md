# Java-Inverted_RightAngle_Triangle
This Java program prints an inverted right-angled number triangle. The user enters a size  𝑛 n, defining the number of rows. The outer loop controls the rows, decreasing from  𝑛 n to 1, while the inner loop prints numbers starting from 1 up to the current row count. Each row decreases in length, forming the inverted triangle pattern.
